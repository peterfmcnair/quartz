- Data
Everything can be quantified by bits, so this is how it is charged.
## Requirements
- Increase user data rate to 100 Mbps downlink and 50 Mbps uplink (for a 20MHz bandwidth)
- Reduce latency (< 5ms for small [IP](Internet%20Protocol.md) packets)
- Low speed (<20km/h) support up to 350km/h
- Increases spectral efficiency of cell-edge users (still interference)
