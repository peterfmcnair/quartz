### Massive [Internet of Things](Internet%20of%20Things.md)
Millions nodes per km^2
### Mission-critical control
Low [latency](latency.md) is key for autonomous vehicles.

## Requirements
- Massive connectivity
	- 1 million devices per km^2
- High [data rates](data%20rate.md) everywhere
	- > 10 Gbps indoor and dense outdoor
	- > 100 Mbps urban and suburban
	- > 10 Mbps - rural areas in developed and developing countries
- Low [latency](latency.md)
	- [end-to-end](end-to-end.md) [latency](latency.md) of 1ms or less
### Table comparing 5G and [4G](4G.md)
