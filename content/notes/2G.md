# 2G
## Requirements

## Solutions
[GSM](Global%20System%20for%20Mobile.md)
[IS-95](Interim%20Standard%2095.md)
Dual-band or triband
Circuit switched data are charged on a per-second basis.
You occupy the whole circuit the whole time.

## Major Breakthroughs
1. Smaller handset (electronics advancements)
2. Longer lifetime of handset
	1. GSM - power control for prolonging battery life
3. [Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying](Gaussian%20Minimum%20Shift%20Keying.md)
4. [Channel coding](Channel%20coding.md)
5. Operators are free to choose [GSM](Global%20System%20for%20Mobile.md) and [Code division multiple access](Code%20division%20multiple%20access.md)

Use GPS to synchronise base stations - issues in Hong Kong where buildings caused GPS signals to be weaker, affected performance.
## Evolution Driving Force
